Carlos Alberto Martínez Sandoval and Dr. Mario Alberto Moreno Rocha.</li></ul><p>Each venue will have its own local general coordination team, a program specifically designed for its context, and particular event dates. Some <em>tracks</em> will be shared between both venues, while others have been independently defined, allowing participants to engage in and enjoy both events.</p><p>To ensure effective integration between teams and to guarantee a coherent and inclusive experience at CLIHC 2026, a <strong>General Articulation Committee</strong> was established, working closely with the local coordination teams. This committee is facilitated by Dr. Soraia Silva Prietch and Dr. Pedro Reynolds-Cuéllar.</p><p>We invite you to explore this website to learn about key dates, active calls, and the different ways to participate.
