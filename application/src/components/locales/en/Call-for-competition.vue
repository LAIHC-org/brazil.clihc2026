    <h3>What is the Student Design Competition (SDC)?</h3>
    <p>
        The Student Design Competition (SDC) is an international academic activity of
        CLIHC 2026 aimed at students. Its objectives are to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Provide a space for students from different disciplines related to
            Human-Computer Interaction, design, and technology to demonstrate their
            skills in analysis, research, design, and evaluation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Foster academic exchange among students, researchers, and professionals
            within the CLIHC community.
        </li>
        <li>
            Offer diverse perspectives on how multidisciplinary teams address relevant
            social and technological problems in Latin American and international
            contexts.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The SDC is an integral part of the conference's academic program.</p>

    <h3>The Design Challenge: Appropriate Solutions for All</h3>
    <p>
        Teams are invited to develop design proposals linked to one or more of the 17
        Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No Poverty</li>
        <li>Zero Hunger</li>
        <li>Good Health and Well-being</li>
        <li>Quality Education</li>
        <li>Gender Equality</li>
        <li>Clean Water and Sanitation</li>
        <li>Affordable and Clean Energy</li>
        <li>Decent Work and Economic Growth</li>
        <li>Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</li>
        <li>Reduced Inequalities</li>
        <li>Sustainable Cities and Communities</li>
        <li>Responsible Consumption and Production</li>
        <li>Climate Action</li>
        <li>Life Below Water</li>
        <li>Life on Land</li>
        <li>Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</li>
        <li>Partnerships for the Goals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The scope of this call is deliberately broad in order to provide participation
        opportunities for as many students across Latin America as possible. Each
        proposed solution must be clearly linked to one (or more) of the 17 Sustainable
        Development Goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teams may adopt design strategies such as participatory design, co-creation and
        co-design, service design, design for social innovation, inclusive design, and
        open innovation. Teams may use participatory and co-creation approaches with
        existing technologies or explore opportunities in contemporary technological
        developments such as 3D printing, digital fabrication, citizen sensing, the
        maker movement, the sharing economy, big data, social networks, IoT,
        gamification, new sensors and actuators, and augmented/virtual reality, among
        others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teams are expected to adopt user-centered design approaches, grounding their
        proposals in an understanding of users' needs, contexts, and experiences. The
        use of user research methods, participatory design, co-creation, and iterative
        evaluation is strongly encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it is important to note that sometimes the best design solution or
        approach may emerge from simple yet sharp insights uncovered through research
        and may require only minimal technology. What matters most is that the solution
        is appropriate for the specific goal being addressed.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Evaluation Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        For this year's design challenge, teams are especially encouraged to consider
        the following criteria as guiding principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is the design clearly linked to one of the Sustainable Development Goals?</li>
        <li>Does the design specify and address a relevant and "burning" problem?</li>
        <li>Does the design use technology in an appropriate and novel way?</li>
        <li>Is the design well-crafted and effectively presented?</li>
        <li>
            Was the design validated in an appropriate and sound way to demonstrate
            fulfillment of its design goals?
        </li>
        <li>Was relevant prior work properly identified and cited?</li>
        <li>Were analysis, synthesis, design, and evaluation systematic and sufficient?</li>
        <li>Was the design developed far enough to demonstrate the key ideas?</li>
        <li>
            Were genuine stakeholders involved in the research, development, and
            evaluation processes?
        </li>
        <li>
            Were the research process and stakeholder involvement ethically appropriate
            (e.g., institutional guidelines were followed)?
        </li>
        <li>
            Did the team explore the broader ecosystem of stakeholders, conditions, and
            contexts?
        </li>
        <li>
            Does the design demonstrate the application of user-centered design methods
            and an understanding of users' needs, contexts, and experiences?
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Student Team Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Teams must consist of at least two (2) and no more than five (5) students.</li>
        <li>There is no limit to the number of teams per institution.</li>
        <li>Each student may participate in only one team.</li>
        <li>
            Submissions are welcome from students at all stages of their academic
            training, including undergraduate, Master's, and Doctoral levels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mixed-level teams are explicitly allowed, meaning that a single team may
            include students from undergraduate, Master's, and/or Doctoral programs,
            and students from any of these levels may participate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Although not mandatory, the formation of multidisciplinary, multinational,
            and gender-diverse teams is strongly encouraged, in alignment with
            principles of equity, inclusion, and collaborative design.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Student Design Competition is exclusively for students. To verify student
        status, teams must submit a signed statement from their academic supervisor
        confirming:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The student's institutional affiliation.</li>
        <li>
            Whether the student was enrolled at the undergraduate or graduate level at
            the time the work was conducted, or confirmation that the student is
            currently enrolled full-time, or will return as a student in the next
            academic term.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Supervision Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each team must have one (1) supervisor.</li>
        <li>Each supervisor may advise one or multiple teams.</li>
        <li>Supervisors may be academics or industry professionals.</li>
        <li>
            Supervisors, mentors, or advisors may not simultaneously serve as chairs,
            reviewers, or judges of the Student Design Competition.
        </li>
        <li>
            The supervisor may be included as the last author of the paper, clearly
            identified as the team advisor. The primary authorship and main contribution
            of the work must remain with the student team.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h3>
    <p>
        The CLIHC Student Design Competition strongly encourages participation by teams
        that reflect principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion, in line with the
        conference and the Human-Computer Interaction community's values.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teams are particularly encouraged to include gender diversity, participants from
        different social and cultural backgrounds, and disciplinary and academic
        diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
        These aspects are not part of the evaluation criteria, but serve as guiding
        principles to promote a more inclusive, representative, and plural academic
        environment.
    </p>

    <h3>Ethical Aspects</h3>
    <p>
        In applicable cases, authors must follow established ethical guidelines for
        research involving human participants. This includes, but is not limited to,
        informed consent, data privacy, and respectful treatment of participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teams are expected to comply with the relevant institutional, national, and
        international regulations on research ethics. Submissions that do not adequately
        address ethical considerations when applicable may be rejected.

        Proposals must not have been previously published or submitted to other
        academic competitions or design contests, either nationally or internationally.
        Failure to comply with this requirement may result in disqualification at any
        stage of the process.
    </p>

    <h3>Policy on the Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)</h3>
    <p>
        The use of large-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT or other similar
        Artificial Intelligence tools, is permitted only if their use is clearly
        disclosed by the authors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any content generated with the assistance of an LLM must be explicitly
        acknowledged whenever such tools are used for purposes beyond basic editing or
        proofreading of the authors' own text. Authors are responsible for reviewing
        and complying with the ACM Policy on Authorship and with principles of
        academic transparency.
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of the submission process, teams must include an explicit declaration
        regarding the use (or non-use) of Artificial Intelligence tools, according to
        the following cases:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Use of AI: NO</strong></p>
    <p>
        If no Artificial Intelligence tools were used in the preparation of the
        submission, authors must include the following statement:
    </p>
    <p>
        We declare that no Artificial Intelligence tools were used to generate, write,
        design, or organize any part of this submission. All content was produced
        exclusively by the members of the student team.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Use of AI: YES</strong></p>
    <p>
        If Artificial Intelligence tools (for example, LLMs such as ChatGPT) were used
        to support any part of the work, authors must include a clear and visible
        declaration, for example:
    </p>
    <p>
        Parts of the content, document organization, and/or ideation support of this
        submission were generated with the assistance of an Artificial Intelligence tool
        (e.g., ChatGPT - OpenAI). All final editing, source verification, interpretation
        of results, and intellectual responsibility remain solely with the authors.
    </p>
    <p>
        The corresponding declaration must be included in the paper, and where
        applicable, also in the presentation and the video.
    </p>
    <p>
        Failure to clearly disclose the use of Artificial Intelligence tools when they
        have been used will be considered a violation of authorship and academic
        transparency policies and may result in disqualification at any stage of the
        review process.
    </p>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>

    </ul>
    <p>
        Each team may apply to only one venue. Submissions to multiple venues are not
        permitted. The selected venue will determine the on-site activities of the
        competition, including the poster session, final presentation, and local
        selection process. Once the submission has been received, changes of venue will
        not be allowed.
    </p>

    <h3>After Acceptance of the Submission</h3>
    <p>
        After conditional acceptance of a submission, the corresponding author of the
        accepted Student Design Competition entry must follow the instructions provided
        for preparing and submitting the final, publication-ready version of all
        required materials before the indicated deadline.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, corresponding authors will receive information regarding
        conference registration and attendance requirements, including presentation
        modality (on-site or virtual), as applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further details about publication procedures, formatting requirements, and
        presentation logistics will be communicated directly to accepted teams after
        notification of acceptance.
    </p>

    <h3>Structure of the Competition</h3>
    <p>
        The CLIHC 2026 Student Design Competition follows a three-round academic
        process. Throughout this process, each team's work will be evaluated by experts
        in design, usability, and Human-Computer Interaction from both academic and
        professional backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each round focuses on communicating the team's ideas through a different medium,
        enabling progressive evaluation of the problem, the design process, and the
        proposed solution.
    </p>

    <h4>Round One: Paper, Presentation, and Video Submission</h4>
    <p>
        In the first round, expert reviewers will evaluate the initial submissions,
        including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Paper</li>
        <li>Presentation (slides)</li>
        <li>Video</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Evaluations will consider problem clarity, the relevance of the solution to the
        selected SDG, the quality of the design process, and the overall coherence of
        the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on this review, up to eight (8) teams per venue will be selected to
        participate in the on-site Student Design Competition activities at CLIHC 2026.
        Teams will be notified of acceptance or rejection by email, along with
        instructions for the next stages of the competition.
    </p>

    <h4>Round Two: Poster Presentation</h4>
    <p>
        Proposals selected in the first round will be evaluated during a poster session
        held as part of the CLIHC 2026 conference program.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this session, teams will present their work to the academic community and
        a panel of judges, explaining:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The problem addressed</li>
        <li>The design process followed</li>
        <li>The proposed solution and its expected impact</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        At least one member of each selected team is expected to participate in this
        session, either in person or virtually, in accordance with the conference
        modalities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on the poster session evaluation, judges will select four (4) finalist
        teams per venue to advance to the final round.
    </p>

    <h4>Round Three: Final Presentation</h4>
    <p>
        The four finalist teams at each venue will present their design process and
        solution in a final Student Design Competition session, open to the conference
        community and subject to logistical conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this final round, teams will deliver an oral presentation, followed by a
        question-and-answer session, both evaluated by a panel of judges.
    </p>
    <p>Final presentations must include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The design process followed by the team</li>
        <li>A concise description of the proposed solution</li>
        <li>
            References to design principles and Human-Computer Interaction theory where
            appropriate
        </li>
        <li>Acknowledgment of partial or incomplete solutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        At the end of this round, one winning team per venue will be selected.
    </p>

    <h4>Final Stage of the CLIHC Student Design Competition</h4>
    <p>
        As the closing activity of the CLIHC 2026 Student Design Competition, the
        winning teams from each venue will participate in a joint final session, held
        either in person or virtually, conceived as a space for academic exchange and
        celebration of student work.
    </p>
    <p>
        This session will determine the overall winner of the CLIHC 2026 Student Design
        Competition, within an academic, collaborative, and international framework,
        and not as a competition between countries.
    </p>

    <h3>Awards and Recognition</h3>
    <p>All finalist teams will receive an official certificate of recognition.</p>
    <p>
        The winning team will be recognized as the Winner of the Student Design
        Competition - CLIHC 2026, and their work will be disseminated through the
        conference's official channels.
