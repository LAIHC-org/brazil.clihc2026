            She is a Full Professor at the Department of Computing of the Federal
            University of São Carlos, Brazil. Her expertise lies in UX design and
            empirical studies in both Human–Computer Interaction and Software Engineering.
            She has served as principal investigator on Research, Development, and
            Innovation projects funded by Brazilian agencies (FAPESP, CNPq, and FUNDEP) as
            well as by Brazilian software companies. She was featured in an interview on
            the future of Agile UX in industry, published in Interaction Design: Beyond
            Human–Computer Interaction (2023), one of the most widely adopted HCI books in
            academia and professional practice. Her current research interests include
            user experience design and evaluation, user experience in complex systems, and
            long-term user experience, developed in close collaboration with industry
            partners in Brazil. Since 2020, she has been recognized as a CNPq Fellow
            (DT-2), an award granted to Brazilian researchers acknowledged as outstanding
            leaders in applied, industry-oriented research.

            He is a Research Scientist at the Robotics and AI Institute (RAI), conducting
            research that provides data to support evidence-based societal decisions on
            the design, integration, and regulation of robotics and artificial
            intelligence. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Linguistics from the National
            University of Colombia and a Master of Science from the Personal Robots group
            at the MIT Media Lab. He completed his Ph.D. jointly in the Arts, Culture, &
            Technology and Media Arts and Sciences departments at the MIT Media Lab. He is
            also a co-founder of Diversa, a design collective and organization focused on
            supporting rural technology initiatives across Colombia.

            Claudia López Moncada works as an academic in the Department of Computer Science at the Federico Santa María
            Technical University (UTFSM) in Valparaíso, Chile. She is also a researcher at the National Center for
            Artificial Intelligence (CENIA) and the Millennium Nucleus for Future of Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)
            in the same country. She earned her doctoral degree in Information Sciences and Technology from the University
            of Pittsburgh. Her work focuses on human-computer interaction (HCI) and person-centered artificial intelligence.
            Claudia is the co-director of the User Experience Laboratory at UTFSM and actively participates in the HCI
            community in Latin America and in initiatives to increase women's participation in computing.

        <p>
            Philippe Palanque is a professor in Computer Science at the University of Toulouse 3 and is the head of the
            department of Reliability of Software and Systems at IRIT (Toulouse Research Lab in Computing Sciences). For
            many years, he has been involved in research projects in the area of Command and Control Systems in multiple
            domains, including drones, multimodal interfaces for military cockpits, ground segment systems in satellite
            control rooms, Air Traffic Control workstations, Flight safety for launchpads, and more. In civil aviation, he
            worked on the specification and certification issues of new interactive cockpits (that have to be compliant with
            the ARINC 661 specification standard) of large airplanes such as the Airbus A350, with a recent focus on
            multi-touch interactions. In all these domains, the joint modeling of the interactive system behavior and user
            tasks was a key aspect to assess and ensure compatibility between operators’ work and the tools provided to them
            to perform this work. He has edited and co-edited more than twenty books or conference proceedings and
            co-authored more than 200 refereed publications in international conferences and journals. He is a member of ACM
            SIGCHI CHI Academy and chair of the IFIP Technical Assembly.
