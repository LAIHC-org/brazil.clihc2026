The Graduate Colloquium provides an opportunity for Latin American graduate students working in HCI and related fields to explore and develop their research interests through an interdisciplinary workshop under the guidance of a panel of prominent researchers. </p><p> We invite graduate students who believe they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply for this unique opportunity to share their research with fellow students and senior researchers in the field. Successful applicants will be those who show a clear topic and research approach and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes to their plan. </p><p> In addition to stating how you will benefit from participation, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Graduate Colloquium. Being accepted into the Colloquium involves a commitment to giving and receiving thoughtful commentary with an eye toward shaping HCI in Latin America and fellow participants in their respective fields. </p><h3>Objectives</h3><ul><li> Offer Latin American HCI graduate students the opportunity to share and discuss their work with experienced researchers. </li><li> Provide feedback on students’ current research and guidance on future research directions. </li><li> Offer each student comments and fresh perspectives on their work from researchers and students outside their own institution. </li><li> Promote the development of a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research among graduate students across Latin American universities. </li><li> Let the community learn about research projects being developed by graduate students. </li></ul><h3>During the Graduate Colloquium</h3><p> Accepted students will present their work to the group, with substantial time allowed for discussion and questions by participating researchers and fellow participants. Detailed instructions will be provided upon acceptance. In-person attendance is expected for this track. </p><h3>Submissions</h3><p> The proposal must have the following four components, all written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. </p><ul><li> Extended Abstract: a 4-page (including references) research description covering central aspects of your graduate work. This document must adhere to the latest version of the Brazilian Computer Society template: authors may choose to work in one of the following formats: Microsoft Word / LaTeX (recommended) or Overleaf. Key points of this document include: <ul><li> Your situation, i.e., the graduate program context in which your work is being conducted (home institution, country, program, year of study, etc). </li><li>Context and motivation that drives your research.</li><li>Research objectives / goals / questions.</li><li>Background/literature review of key work that frames your research.</li><li> Hypothesis/thesis, research question and/or problem statement. </li><li> Followed research approach and methods, including relevant rationale. </li><li>Results to date and their validity.</li><li> Dissertation status and next steps (i.e., what you have done and what you have left to do). </li><li>Current and expected contributions.</li></ul></li><li> A one-paragraph statement of expected benefits of participation for both yourself and the other colloquium participants (i.e., what you will contribute as well as gain) (max 1 page). </li><li> A letter of nomination from your primary dissertation/final project advisor that addresses the value that the Graduate Colloquium would have for you, what contribution you are likely to make to the event, and why this is a good time for you to participate (max 1 page). </li><li> A concise version of your current Curriculum Vitae, emphasizing academic background, research background, and relevant publications (if any) (1-2 pages). </li><li> Submit your proposal as a single PDF file through JEMS Platform, to the Graduate Colloquium’s track by the deadline: <a href="https://jems3.sbc.org.br/events/" class="uline">https://jems3.sbc.org.br/events/</a></li></ul><p> Accepted proposals will be published in the SBC-OpenLib (SOL) digital library: <a href="https://sol.sbc.org.br/" class="uline">https://sol.sbc.org.br/</a></p><h3>Selection Process</h3><p> The review and decision of acceptance will balance many factors. This includes the quality of your proposal and your current position in your graduate program. Candidates who have a clearly developed idea, who are formally considered by their institution to be working on their dissertation or final project, and who still have time to be influenced by participation in the Colloquium will receive the strongest consideration. </p><p> In addition to assessing research quality, the selection process will also consider other factors. The goal is to identify a group of students who will benefit significantly from the Colloquium and support one another in their growth. As a group, the accepted candidates will exhibit a diversity of backgrounds and topics. </p><h3 id="cgc-dates">Important dates (GC)</h3><ul><li>Submission of GC proposals: <strong class="text-danger">March 14, 2026</strong></li><li>Notification: March 30, 2026</li><li>Camera-ready submission: April 12, 2026</li><li>Graduate Colloquium: TBD, in May 2026</li></ul>',16),S={class:"my-4"},T={class:"row"},A={class:"col-md-4"},I=e("div",{class:"d-block blur-shadow-image"},[e("img",{src:b,alt:"Roberto Pereira",class:"img-fluid shadow rounded-3"})],-1),M=e("div",{class:"colored-shadow",style:{"background-image":"url('/assets/img/people/robertoPereira.png')"}},null,-1),O={class:"col-md-4"},P=e("div",{class:"d-block blur-shadow-image"},[e("img",{src:y,alt:"Claudia López Moncada",class:"img-fluid shadow rounded-3"})],-1),z=e("div",{class:"colored-shadow",style:{"background-image":"url('/assets/img/people/claudiaLopez.png')"}},null,-1);function B(s,D,R,n,j,F){const l=r("RouterLink"),a=r("OrganizerItem");return h(),u(g,null,[e("ol",v,[e("li",_,[e("div",k,[C,x,q,i(l,{to:n.Tr.i18nRoute({name:"graduate-colloquium",hash:"#cgc-dates"}),class:"uline"},{default:t(()=>[o(" See all important dates ")]),_:1},8,["to"])])])]),L,e("h3",S,m(s.$t("organizers.graduate_colloquium_chairs_title")),1),e("div",T,[e("div",A,[i(a,null,{image:t(()=>[I,M]),name:t(()=>[o(" Dr. Roberto Pereira ")]),institution:t(()=>[o(" UFPR, BR ")]),email:t(()=>[]),_:1})]),e("div",O,[i(a,null,{image:t(()=>[P,z]),name:t(()=>[o(" Dra.
